            <h1>Responsive Redesign Project</h1>
            <h2>The Assignment</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, we had to redesign a website to make it more 
                efficient and accessible to users. We had to go through the 
                redesign process, identifying flaws in an existing interface, 
                creating low-fidelty and high-fidelity prototypes for different
                screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on the 
                prototypes. 
                /p>
            <p> I chose to redesign the <a href="https://www.ceremonypvd.com">Ceremony PVD website</a> 
                to make the buttons more responsive to page size, as well as 
                more obvious to the users that they are buttons. Additionally, 
                I changed the formatting of the page to the F-shaped pattern to
                put the text on the left side of the page in the image on the 
                right side, so that the user is easily able to navigate through 
                the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following will demonstrate the redesign process I went through. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Identifying Flaws in the Existing Interface
            </h2>
            <p>
                I chose Ceremony's website for this assignment because I have 
                tried to navigate this webpage with some difficulty before. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Original Website: 
            </h3>
            <img src="original_website.png" alt="Ceremony's Original Interface">
            <p>
                Some flaws that I identified are as follows: 
                <ul>
                    <li>The website on computers does not use a flex box for 
                        the navigation bar, so when the screen is smaller, 
                        like shown above, the buttons move below and create a 
                        column of navigation buttons instead of staying intact 
                        in a row and adjusting with the size of the screen. </li>
                    <li>The colors of the text do not pop out and make it 
                        easy to read. </li>
                    <li>It is hard to tell that the row of buttons are actually 
                        buttons, since there is no change when hovering over the
                        buttons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are no titles on the page that give information. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>
                Accessibility
            </h2>
            <img src="accesibility.png" alt="Ceremony Examined by WAVE's Accessibility Tool">
            <p>
                Some accessibility problems I identified are: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are empty links at the bottom of the page to an 
                        email address, Instagram profile, and Facebook profile. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        There is no header. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        There is small text. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is null or empty alternative text for the image.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I agree with some of the problems detected. I would add a header 
                and increase the text size of the navigation bar. I also would 
                include alt text for images. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Speed Sketches
            </h2>
            <p>
                The next part of the assignment was to do 9, 1 minute sketches 
                to come up with some different ideas for redesigning the page. 
            </p>
            <img src="speed_sketches.jpg" alt="My Speed Sketches">
            <p>
                After doing these speed sketches, I created a final sketch of what
                I wanted to website to look like, combining ideas from the sketches
                to establish this final sketch. 
            </p>
            <img src="final sketch.jpg" alt="Final Sketch">
            <p>
                Some elements that I chose for the final sketch were creating 
                buttons that were more recognizable as buttons by putting boxes
                around them, adding a header of some kind, switing the text and 
                the images, and making the links at the bottom of the page more 
                recognizable. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Low-Fidelity Wireframing
            </h2>
            <p>
                Next, I created some low-fiedlity wireframes for different screen
                sizes. I chose to implement a collapsable menu for both the mobile
                phone and tablet sized screens. 
            </p>
            <img src="mobile low.png" alt="Mobile Low-Fidelity Wireframe">
            <p>
                This design has a navigable menu that includes the links to the 
                different pages of the website. Also, it is arranged where the 
                information is at the top and you have to scroll down for less 
                relevant information. Additionally, you do not lose any content 
                left to right and everything fits cleanly on one page. Each box 
                represents a flexbox with responsive units that fit to the size 
                of the screen. 
            </p>
            <img src="tablet low.png" alt="Tablet Low-Fidelity Wireframe">
            <p>
                This format for the tablet has similar features of the mobile 
                wireframe, but it is organized a little differently to fit the 
                bigger screen. It still has a menu that you can click on to see 
                all of the different buttons that lead to other pages. If it 
                keeps the links like the webpage, then it would not fit the 
                screen well and you would have to scroll left to right to access 
                all of the different pages. In this way, everything is laid out 
                vertically, allowing users to scroll to access all information. 
                It also is in a logical order from most to least relevant 
                information. Each box represents a flexbox with responsive units 
                that fit to the size of the screen. 
            </p>
            <img src="desktop low.jpg" alt="Desktop Low-Fidelity Wireframe">
            <p>
                The desktop wireframe implements the F style of organizing 
                information, putting the navigation menu across the top then 
                following with important text on the left and a less relevant 
                image on the right. It also lists the links to contact them at 
                the bottom of the page in a footer. Each box represents a 
                flexbox with responsive units that fit to the size of the 
                screen. It also will use a grid to organize the content between 
                the header and footer.  
            </p>
            <h2>
                Visual Design Style Guide
            </h2>
            <p>
                Before creating high-fidelity prototypes based off of the low-fidelity 
                wireframes, I created a style guide in Figma that would govern 
                what each element would look like. Some design choices I made 
                were easily readable fonts, 
            </p>

            <h2>
                High-Fidelity Prototypes
            </h2>
            <p>
                In Figma, I created three high-fidelity wireframes for a mobile
                device, tablet, and desktop.

            <p>
                After creating the high-fidelity wireframes, I created the 
                HTML and CSS for the redesigned website. You can access the 
                website <a href="https://kaitlynwilliams23.github.io/cs1300_responsiveredesign/">here</a>. Below 
                is a picture of what the website I designed looks like:

                What I Learned and Wish I Did Better
            </h2>
            <p>
                This process allowed me to gain valuable insights on how to begin 
                and move through the redesign process of an interface. Next time,
                something I would do differently is spend more time on the 
                high-fidelity wireframes to make creating the HTML and CSS for 
                the interface a little easier. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish I was able to make a menu that was clickable when the 
                screen got smaller than 800px. This would have made the page more
                responsive. Something else I found difficult to implement was 
                centering the image on the right side of the body of the page.
